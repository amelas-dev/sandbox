# Investor Document Studio – Compliance & Security Audit

## Executive Summary

The Investor Document Studio is a single-page React application that enables analysts to design investor-ready documents with
dataset-driven merge tags. The current state of the codebase demonstrates modern React and TypeScript practices with
significant attention to usability. This audit performs a comprehensive review focused on federal security and reliability
expectations, introduces hardening patches, and documents operational safeguards for continued compliance.

## Scope

- Source code under `src/`, associated build tooling, and runtime configuration.
- Dataset ingestion pipeline (`src/lib/dataset.ts`) supporting CSV, JSON, and XLSX inputs.
- Merge rendering and export helpers (`src/lib/merge.ts`, `src/lib/exporters.ts`).
- Client-side persistence and template sharing utilities.
- Automated testing, linting, and development workflow.

## Key Improvements Delivered

1. **Input Validation & Limits** – CSV/JSON/XLSX parsers now enforce configurable limits on row/column counts, header length,
   and cell size. Values exceeding limits are truncated with explicit import issues and the pipeline rejects oversized
   datasets before they can exhaust browser memory.
2. **Template Integrity Validation** – Imported templates undergo structural validation to prevent malformed or malicious
   JSON from mutating application state. A dedicated `TemplateValidationError` surfaces issues without disrupting the session.
3. **HTML Escape of Merge Output** – Merge tag substitution now defaults to HTML escaping to eliminate the risk of runtime
   cross-site scripting when datasets contain untrusted values.
4. **Export Workflow Hardening** – Temporary DOM containers used during PDF generation are cleaned up reliably and the export
   function refuses to run when no artifacts are available, preventing silent failures.
5. **Documentation & Observability** – Extensive inline documentation and a public audit record (this file) establish
   traceability for future reviews and onboarding.
6. **Test Infrastructure Modernization** – The project now uses Vitest with jsdom, coverage reporting, and type-checked test
   suites. This aligns with Node 18+ environments common in federal deployments.

## Risk Assessment

| Area | Risk Rating | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Dataset ingestion | **Medium → Low** | Boundaries now enforced; remaining risk limited to extremely large XLSX parsing (dependent on upstream `xlsx`). |
| Template import/export | **Medium → Low** | Runtime validation and reliable cleanup reduce attack surface. |
| Merge rendering | **Medium → Low** | HTML escaping eliminates XSS vectors; filenames sanitized. |
| Persistence | **Low** | Zustand persistence restricted to trusted keys; ephemeral datasets supported. |
| Build & dependencies | **Medium** | Modern dependencies with dynamic imports; continue monitoring for supply-chain advisories. |

## Recommendations for Continued Compliance

- **Penetration Testing** – Conduct annual third-party testing focused on client-side rendering and browser storage.
- **Dependency Review Cadence** – Schedule quarterly dependency updates with `npm audit` and SBOM regeneration.
- **Logging Strategy** – Introduce optional telemetry hooks (behind feature flags) to trace dataset import failures in
  production environments.
- **Accessibility Verification** – Expand automated a11y checks (e.g., axe-core) across primary workflows.
- **Disaster Recovery** – Establish documented backup/restore procedures for templates stored in `localStorage`, possibly via
  encrypted server synchronization.

## Testing Performed

- `npm run test` (Vitest) covering dataset parsing, merge substitution, and filename rendering with new edge cases.
- `npm run lint` to ensure TypeScript and React files comply with project standards.
- Manual verification of dataset import guardrails and template import validation.

## Change Log Summary

- Enforced dataset parsing limits with sanitized records and import issue tracking.
- Added runtime guards for template import/export.
- Escaped HTML when substituting merge tags and hardened document export flows.
- Introduced Vitest configuration, jsdom environment, and coverage reporting.
- Authored inline documentation to describe component responsibilities and data flow.
- Created this audit artifact to document scope, findings, and remediation work.
